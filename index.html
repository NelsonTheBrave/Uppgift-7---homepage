          <h2>Some info about me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi! I am student of
            <strong>systems development and web design</strong>, focusing mainly
            on <strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Java</strong>. My life has gone
            in many different directions to this point. I was interested in
            programming already as a kid, when my older sister taught me how to
            program basic events in Macromedia Flash, and I spent weeks playing
            around with making games and animated clips. However, I spent most
            of my adulthood pursuing other interests, such as music, composition
            and dancing, and ended up doing a bachelor in Environmental Science
            after a little detour in the field of Psychology. I've lately
            regained my passion for the creativity and problem solving of
            programming, and enjoyed feeling like a child once again as I lose
            track of time tinkering around with functions and flexboxes. It's a
            privilege to study something and have so much fun at the same time
            and I look forward to the coming two years of gaining more and more
            advanced skills and eventually starting my work in this craft.
